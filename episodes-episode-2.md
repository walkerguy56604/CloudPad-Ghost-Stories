# CloudPad Ghost Stories 👻💻  
## Season 1, Episode 2: *The Phantom of the API*  

---

### Teaser  

Last time, the ghosts escaped from Nhost and turned CloudPad into a haunted backend playground.  
But just as the devs were getting used to their new supernatural teammates, a **new problem** emerged…  

---

### Panel 1 – The Suspicious Endpoint  
- **Dev 👨‍💻:** “Why does `/api/v1/data` suddenly return a *scream* instead of JSON?”  
- **Dev 👩‍💻:** “That’s not an error code I’ve ever seen before…”  

---

### Panel 2 – The Phantom Appears  
- A shadowy 👻 larger than the others looms from the API gateway.  
- **Phantom Ghost:** “I am the Phantom of the API! Keeper of undocumented endpoints!”  

---

### Panel 3 – Dev Reactions  
- **Dev 👨‍💻:** “...We’re definitely not prepared for this.”  
- **Dev 👩‍💻:** “Quick, check the logs before it eats our tokens!”

### Next Time…  
*Will the devs tame the Phantom of the API?*  
*Will Nhost survive another haunting?*  
*And who left the debug flag on in production… again?*
